     * Creates an instance of a class, initializing its fields from a {@link Config}.

     * <pre>
     * Config configSource = ConfigFactory.load().getConfig("foo");
     * FooConfig config = ConfigBeanFactory.create(configSource, FooConfig.class);
     * </pre>
     *
     * The Java class should follow JavaBean conventions. Field types
     * can be any of the types you can normally get from a {@link
     * Config}, including <code>java.time.Duration</code> or {@link
     * ConfigMemorySize}. Fields may also be another JavaBean-style
     * class.
     *
     * Fields are mapped to config by converting the config key to
     * camel case.  So the key <code>foo-bar</code> becomes JavaBean
     * setter <code>setFooBar</code>.
